# **App Name**: Monochrome Canvas

## Core Features:

- Blank Slate: Provides a default page with minimal content in black and white.
- Shadcn UI Integration: Integrates Shadcn UI components for a consistent and customizable design system.
- Layout Structure: Offers a basic layout structure (header, main content, footer) using Shadcn components.
- Theming Support: Includes basic theme support to handle different shades of gray for different parts of the application.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Almost black (#09090b) for a dark, solid base.
- Background color: Near white (#fcfcfc), providing high contrast against the primary.
- Accent color: Light gray (#d4d4d8) used sparingly for interactive elements to provide subtle feedback without disrupting the monochrome theme.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif, which gives a neutral look suitable for both headlines and body text.
- Use simple line icons in shades of gray to maintain the monochrome aesthetic.
- Emphasize clean, minimalist layouts with plenty of whitespace.
- Use subtle fade or slide animations for transitions to enhance the user experience without distracting from the monochrome design.
